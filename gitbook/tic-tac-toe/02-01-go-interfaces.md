# Go Interfaces

Interface is a very powerful tool for achieving duck typings in Go. It enables us to create strong API contract across packages, and create mock for unit testing. Since Go is strongly typed, every function expects a concrete type. For example,

```go
func Feed(d *Dog) bool {
    // Return true if the dog accepts the feeding, else return false.
}
```

The `Feed` function can only feed dogs due to the strong typed nature of the language. One may naturally ask, _what if I want to feed a cat?_

```go
func FeedCat(c *Cat) bool {
    // Implementation...
}

func FeedDog(d *Dog) bool {
    // Implementation...
}
```

That obviously does not look good because in practice we would like to write one function that feeds as many animals as possible. So `interface` comes to rescue. We define an animal interface.

```go
type Food struct{}

type Animal interface{
    Eat(Food)
}
```

Any data structure that implements the function `Eat` with argument `Food` is said to be satisfying the `Animal` interface.

```go
type Dog struct{}

func (d *Dog) Eat(f Food) {
    // Eat...
}

type Cat struct{}

func (c *Cat) Eat(f Food) {
    // Eat
}
```

Now we just need to modify the argument type of `Feed` function a little bit.

```go
func Feed(a Animal) bool {
    // Now we can feed anything that has Eat()
}
```

## Unit Tests

Suppose we want to isolate the `Feed` function unit tests from the `Animal` unit tests, we can mock the animals!

```go
type MockDog struct{}

func (md *MockDog) Eat(f Food) {
    assert.True(f.Type == "DOG_FOOD")
    assert.Called()
}
```

And then pass it into `Feed` and see if the test passes.

```go
md := &MockDog
Feed(md)
```
